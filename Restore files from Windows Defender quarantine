For anyone else having this, Windows defender won't restore the files because they are dangerous so they don't even appear in history.  
You gotta open the cmd, then run this command to navigate to the Windows Defender folder  

cd "%ProgramFiles%\Windows Defender"  

then run this to see the quarantined files that won't appear  

MpCmdRun.exe -restore -listall  

Then run this command to restore the files  

MpCmdRun.exe -restore -name WriteThreatNameHere  

and you are done
